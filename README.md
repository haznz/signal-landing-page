# Signal Join Page

This is a simple web page that helps people join a Signal group.

Some apps (like Facebook and Instagram) open links inside their own browser, and Signal links don’t work properly there. This page explains what to do so the link opens correctly.

## 🤔 Why This Exists

If someone taps a Signal invite link inside:
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Messenger

…the link often fails.

This page:
- Shows a message explaining the problem
- Tells the user how to open the link in their normal browser
- Lets them continue once it’s opened properly
